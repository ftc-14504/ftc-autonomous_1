Initial Code. Please Read before commiting your own code, updating.

Commits should only be made at practice when the entire software team can look over the code to decide what will be used. Otherwise you are free to download the code and make changes at your will. However do not commit without the entire team deciding on the most efficient code. If there isn't a meeting in a bit, place the code on the software channel in slack so the enitre team can take a look at your code.
